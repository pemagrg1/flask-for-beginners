# Getting started withÂ Flask
An easy way to get started with Flask for Beginners
Working with Flask (a micro web framework written in python) was one of the things that I really wanted to try but was never able to ðŸ˜•


But finally!! I did itâ€¦.yaaay!! and am really excited to share it with ya allâ€¦ It's super easy and super cool.
I'll help you with the basics of creating a website using HTML and to add a route through the flask.


First, install the Flask package: pip install Flask


Create a new folder and inside your project folder, create a static folder and templates folder.
The static folder will have your CSS and images while templates will hold your HTML files. This is important as initially when I tried working on Flask while having no clue about the directory tree, I was not able to run the file that's when I found out that flask looks for templates for views where the HTML files lie. And api.py is the main file which you will have to run to make your HTML file work!


#### INSTALLATION GUIDE:
open your terminal and

` git clone https://github.com/pemagrg1/flask-for-beginners.git`

`cd flask-for-beginners`

`$ python3 api.py`
